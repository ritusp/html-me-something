        <p>Indian Kitchen is filled with regional Indian curries. With recipes to fit into your lifestyle whether 
            you’re short of time and want a quick meal, or have friends and family coming over and want to cook a feast.</p>
        <p>The great Indian 'kari', which stems from the word for sauce in Tamil, is known to have originated sometime 
            during the ancient Indus civilization. Since then it has travelled beyond boundaries and created many fans across
            the globe.</p>
        <p>The curry adopts different flavours as you walk across regional boundaries. It is a bold base that adds depth
            and interest to the any dish. Robust, velvety, brilliantly buttery, creamy, tangy - every state boasts of a 
            different version of chicken curry recipe. We love the versatility that Indian curries offer. In Northern and
            Eastern India, you'll be served a hearty curry bursting with garam masala and other spices along with crisp 
            naans. As you move towards the west, warm notes of poppy-seeds, cardamom and khada masalas dominate the dish 
            that sits atop a bed of steaming rice. From down South, comes a soothing coconut-y concoction with the addition
            of coconut milk.The cooking medium of different chicken gravies also differ as per local tastes. For instance,
            ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil is used predominantly in North India and coconut oil lends it unique
            flavor to Southern curries. Mustard oil brightens up the curries from East and the West is known for the heavy
            use of sesame and groundnut oil.</p>
